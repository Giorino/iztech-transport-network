\chapter{Experimental Evaluation}
\label{ch:experiments}

This chapter presents the experimental evaluation of the graph-based methodologies proposed in Chapter~\ref{ch:method} for optimizing the student transportation network of the Izmir Institute of Technology (IZTECH). The primary objective is to identify the most effective combination of graph construction techniques and clustering algorithms to minimize total transportation costs while adhering to vehicle capacity constraints (10 to 50 students per bus route). The experiments utilize the synthetically generated student location dataset described in Section~\ref{sec:graph_representation}, representing approximately 2000 students distributed across Izmir based on population data.

\section{Evaluation Metrics}
\label{sec:eval_metrics}

To quantitatively compare the different approaches, we employ the following evaluation metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Total Transportation Cost (TL):} Estimated based on the total distance traveled by all buses and fuel consumption rates. This is the primary optimization target.
    \item \textbf{Number of Routes:} The total number of clusters generated, which corresponds to the number of buses required.
    \item \textbf{Average Route Length (km):} The average length of the optimized path within each cluster, computed using Dijkstra's algorithm (Section~\ref{subsec:DijkstrasAlgorithm}).
    \item \textbf{Average Cluster Size:} The average number of students assigned to each route.
    \item \textbf{Computational Time (s):} Time taken for graph construction and clustering phases.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiment 1: Impact of Graph Sparsity}
\label{sec:exp_sparsity}

We first analyze the impact of graph representation choice on the feasibility and outcome of the transportation network analysis. We compare the baseline Complete Graph (Section~\ref{subsec:complete_graph}) against the sparse representations: Delaunay Triangulation (Section~\ref{subsubsec:delaunay}), Gabriel Graph (Section~\ref{subsubsec:gabriel}), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) graph with $k=30$ (Section~\ref{subsubsec:knn}).

Table~\ref{tab:graph_properties} summarizes the key properties of each graph constructed from the $|V| \approx 2000$ student locations. As expected, the sparse graphs significantly reduce the number of edges compared to the Complete Graph, making subsequent processing more computationally tractable.

Complete & $\approx 2000$ & $1.999 \times 10^{6}$ & $4.32 \times 10^{4}$ \\
Delaunay & $\approx 2000$ & $5.647 \times 10^{3}$ & $3.02 \times 10^{2}$ \\
Gabriel & $\approx 2000$ & $3.598 \times 10^{3}$ & $2.88 \times 10^{2}$ \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Properties of Different Graph Constructions for $|V| \approx 2000$ Student Locations, where $|E_{complete}| = 1.999 \times 10^{6}$.}
\end{table}

Clustering the Complete Graph (using the Leiden algorithm as described in Section~\ref{subsec:clustering_complete}) serves as a theoretical baseline. Notably, the construction time for the Complete Graph (43,200 seconds, or 12 hours) is orders of magnitude higher than for the sparse methods, further underscoring its impracticality for large datasets. Moreover, clustering this graph often resulted in imbalanced clusters (see Section~\ref{subsubsec:minibus_solution} for discussion on potential mitigation and current limitations), highlighting the need for sparse graph representations. Table~\ref{tab:complete_graph_clustering} shows the baseline results from clustering the complete graph. Detailed route information can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_detailed_results}, Table~\ref{tab:appendix_leiden_complete}.

\end{tabular}

\end{table}

The high computational cost and tendency towards imbalanced clusters motivate the evaluation of clustering algorithms on the sparse graph representations.

\section{Experiment 2: Comparison of Clustering Algorithms on Sparse Graphs}
\label{sec:exp_clustering}

We evaluated three distinct clustering algorithms, detailed in Section~\ref{se:GraphBasedClusterings}, on the sparse graph representations: Spectral Clustering (Section~\ref{subsec:SpectralClustering}), Leiden Algorithm (Section~\ref{subsec:LeidenAlgorithm}), and Multi-view Anchor Graph-based Clustering (MVAGC) (Section~\ref{subsec:MVAGC}). Each algorithm was configured as described in Section~\ref{subsec:clustering_sparse}, including post-processing steps to enforce the 10-50 student capacity constraints.

Tables~\ref{tab:delaunay_results}, \ref{tab:gabriel_results}, and \ref{tab:knn_results} present the aggregated performance metrics for each combination of clustering algorithm and sparse graph type, focusing on the results using only standard buses. The detailed per-route results, including community IDs, node counts, distances, and costs for each specific algorithm and graph combination (Spectral/Delaunay, Leiden/Delaunay, MVAGC/Delaunay, Spectral/Gabriel, Leiden/Gabriel, MVAGC/Gabriel, Spectral/KNN, Leiden/KNN, MVAGC/KNN), can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_detailed_results}, specifically in Tables~\ref{tab:appendix_spectral_delaunay} through \ref{tab:appendix_mvagc_knn}.

Figures~\ref{fig:cost_comparison} and \ref{fig:routes_comparison} provide a visual summary of the total cost and number of routes across all combinations. Figure~\ref{fig:cost_comparison} clearly illustrates that the Gabriel graph with Leiden clustering achieves the lowest transportation cost among all combinations, while Figure~\ref{fig:routes_comparison} demonstrates the corresponding reduction in the required number of routes, confirming the efficiency of this approach.

The results indicate that the combination of the Gabriel graph and the Leiden algorithm yielded the lowest overall transportation cost (115,095.07 TL) and required the fewest buses (62). The Spectral/KNN combination was the second-best in terms of cost (122,696.43 TL) with 67 routes. The Spectral/Gabriel combination showed a similar cost (123,648.12 TL) with slightly more routes (68). The MVAGC/Delaunay combination yielded the highest cost (151,810.10 TL) and required the most buses (80), making it the least efficient option. Interestingly, the Leiden/KNN combination (123,075.14 TL), while not offering the lowest cost, provided a balanced cluster size (29.64). As illustrated in Figures~\ref{fig:cost_comparison} and \ref{fig:routes_comparison}, the choice of graph representation and clustering algorithm significantly impacts the optimization outcomes.

\section{Experiment 3: Impact of Outlier Detection}
\label{sec:exp_outlier}

In this experiment, we investigate the impact of applying the KNN distance-based outlier detection method, as described in Section~\ref{subsec:knn_outlier_application}, on the quality and efficiency of the resulting transportation network clusters. The outlier detection process was designed to identify and remove anomalous student locations that could potentially skew clustering results and lead to suboptimal routes.


Tables~\ref{tab:outlier_gabriel_results}, \ref{tab:outlier_delaunay_results}, and \ref{tab:outlier_knn_results} present the comparative results for each graph construction method with and without outlier detection, focusing on key performance metrics.

Figure~\ref{fig:outlier_cost_comparison} provides a visual representation of the impact of outlier detection on total cost across all graph and algorithm combinations. This figure clearly demonstrates that applying outlier detection consistently reduces transportation costs for every combination of graph construction and clustering algorithm, with the most substantial improvement observed for the Gabriel graph with Leiden clustering.

    \label{fig:outlier_cost_comparison}
\end{figure}


The results demonstrate that outlier detection consistently improves transportation network efficiency across all graph construction methods and clustering algorithms.

Key observations highlight several benefits. Firstly, applying KNN distance-based outlier detection led to an average cost reduction of 3.8\% across all combinations. The most significant improvement was observed with the Leiden algorithm on the Gabriel graph, where costs decreased by 4.1\% (from 115,095.07 TL to 110,364.09 TL). Secondly, outlier detection consistently reduced the number of required routes by 1-2 buses across all combinations. The Gabriel graph with Leiden clustering showed the largest reduction, requiring 60 buses with outlier detection compared to 62 without, representing a 3.2\% reduction in the required fleet size.

Furthermore, the average cluster size increased consistently when outlier detection was applied, suggesting more effective utilization of bus capacity. For example, the average cluster size for Leiden/Gabriel increased from 31.74 to 32.63 students per bus. Despite having larger clusters, the average route length decreased across all combinations when outlier detection was applied. For instance, the Leiden/Gabriel combination showed a 6.5\% reduction in average route length (from 14.01 km to 13.10 km). Lastly, the preprocessing step for outlier detection added negligible computational overhead while improving solution quality, with overall computation times remaining similar or slightly reduced due to the smaller dataset after outlier removal.

The combination of the Gabriel graph construction with the Leiden clustering algorithm continued to yield the best performance, achieving the lowest overall transportation cost of 110,364.09 TL when outlier detection was applied. This represents a significant improvement over the baseline Leiden/Complete graph result (123,882.96 TL) reported in Section~\ref{sec:exp_sparsity}, with a total cost reduction of approximately 11.0\%.

These outcomes confirm that the application of KNN distance-based outlier detection, as detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:knn_outlier_application}, effectively enhances solution quality by refining the dataset. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:outlier_cost_comparison}, the improvement is consistent across all tested methods, reinforcing the value of this preprocessing step.

These findings highlight the importance of data preprocessing in transportation network optimization. The KNN distance-based outlier detection method provided a computationally efficient way to improve the quality of the resulting clusters without significantly increasing the overall processing time. For real-world transportation planning scenarios, this suggests that investing in outlier detection and data cleaning can yield substantial returns in terms of operational efficiency and cost savings.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of graph-based methods for optimizing the IZTECH student transportation network. Key findings include:

Sparse graph representations such as Delaunay, Gabriel, and KNN are essential for computational tractability and often result in better routing solutions compared to the complete graph. This finding supports the approach described in Section~\ref{sec:graph_representation} of Chapter~\ref{ch:method}.

The choice of both the sparse graph construction method and the clustering algorithm has a significant impact on the final solution's cost, number of routes, and route characteristics. This result confirms the importance of the methodological framework presented in Section~\ref{sec:clustering_graph} and its subsections in Chapter~\ref{ch:method}.

The combination of Gabriel graph construction (Section~\ref{subsubsec:gabriel}) with the Leiden algorithm (Section~\ref{subsubsec:leiden_implementation}) and KNN distance-based outlier detection (Section~\ref{subsec:knn_outlier_application}) provided the most promising results, achieving the lowest total cost and number of routes. This outcome proves the effectiveness of our proposed method in these sections of Chapter~\ref{ch:method}.

Outlier detection consistently improved performance across all graph-algorithm combinations, reducing costs and the number of required buses. This demonstrates that the data preprocessing step in Section~\ref{subsec:knn_outlier_application} of Chapter~\ref{ch:method} is a valuable addition to the optimization pipeline.

There are trade-offs between different methods, but the Gabriel graph with Leiden clustering and outlier detection achieved the best overall results. This concludes that our method, as described in Sections~\ref{subsubsec:gabriel}, ~\ref{subsubsec:leiden_implementation}, and ~\ref{subsec:knn_outlier_application} of Chapter~\ref{ch:method}, is robust and effective.

The Leiden algorithm showed strong performance across different graph types, especially on the Gabriel graph, supporting the algorithmic choices made in Section~\ref{subsubsec:leiden_implementation} of Chapter~\ref{ch:method}.

All evaluated methods successfully produced routes adhering to the 10-50 student capacity constraints when applied to sparse graphs, unlike the baseline complete graph approach. This proves the practical applicability of our method as implemented in Section~\ref{sec:clustering_graph} of Chapter~\ref{ch:method}.

These results suggest that adopting a Gabriel graph representation (Section~\ref{subsubsec:gabriel}) combined with Leiden clustering (Section~\ref{subsubsec:leiden_implementation}) and KNN distance-based outlier detection (Section~\ref{subsec:knn_outlier_application}) offers the strongest strategy for IZTECH to optimize its existing bus fleet usage. The preprocessing step of outlier removal proves to be a valuable addition to the optimization pipeline, requiring minimal computational overhead while providing substantial improvements in solution quality.
