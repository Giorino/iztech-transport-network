\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction} % label the chapters (and sections) such that you can refer to them

In a preamble (even before the first section) you can describe both the goal and content of this chapter -- it is also helpful to give a short outline of the chapter. That is, one describes what can be found in which section and subsection. By means of labels you can refer to chapters -- e.g.~Chapter~\ref{ch:basics} -- or sections -- e.g.~Section. Remember that at least two sections are required at each level.
